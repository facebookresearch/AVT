# Generated using gen_ucf_torchvision_fmt.sh.
# Sym-linked from /dataset so should be good to read at scale
# Must not have the "/" in the end
# because of the way _select_fold in ucf101 is implemented (literally uses
# len(root).. disregarding whether there is a "/" in the end or not)

# Just using dataset_train variable interpolation, assuming fold is
# same at train and eval. Ideally hydra would allow for relative variable
# interpolations, since this ucf/train may not *always* be used at training
# time...
